# Summary - Personal Project:
- It was my first big application. I learned a lot of Python concepts and software development.
- I learned how to scale and modularize the code better, OOP, control the flow, manage data, and more.
- Together with the channel owner, we did everything. We thought of the game, searched for assets, and got feedback from the viewers.
- Since I didn't know how to use git, I lost all the material.

## Game - Pokémon Trivia:
- In an Excel sheet, we had all the Pokémon and their attributes. Things like generation, size, weight, color, etc.
- I created a hidden dashboard for the viewers where the streamer could filter with conditions.

## How was the game played?
- Example condition: Fire-type Pokémon, from generation 3 and 5, weighing less than 100kg.
1. The streamer would filter and display the condition on screen.
2. Viewers read the condition and had to type in the chat which Pokémon met the filter.
3. A bot constantly read the Twitch messages and classified whether they were correct or not.
4. The bot would add or subtract points based on whether the Pokémon was correct, and store them in a text file.
- Positive: The Pokémon, the viewer's name, and the points won were displayed on screen.
- Negative: Points were subtracted from the viewer.
